# TODO-list-project
I have created a TODO list project in which one can add day to day activities and delete as well once activity gets completed. 
In this project I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON and bootstring.
We can delete whole list once all tasks are completed and set new tasks and its description using add items button.
